# Saving files

We’ve created areas containing categories and in those categories we have Johnny.Decimal numbers. We’re now ready to hold our actual things.

**This is where your stuff lives.** This is where you keep your spreadsheets and your Word documents and your scanned receipts and your notes and references and emails and whatever else you keep in your system.

## Ooh, pretty

		<p>Neatness is the key. If things are neat, you know where they are.</p>
		<p>
			We save our stuff <strong>in our Johnny.Decimal folders.</strong>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## Never ever do this

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
	<div className="flex-shrink-0 mb-4 pr-4">
		<img
			src={Finder_sampleCompany_area1019IncorrectDocument}

		/>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			A very important note:{" "}
			<strong>
				you may not store things anywhere other than in a folder with a full
				Johnny.Decimal number.
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>That means you’re not allowed to do this...</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
	<div className="flex-shrink-0 mb-4 pr-4">
		<img
			src={Finder_sampleCompany_category11IncorrectDocument}

			height="172"

		/>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			...or this.{" "}
			<strong>The important finance document must relate to something!</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Find what category that something is, and if it doesn’t exist, create it.
			Then create a new Johnny.Decimal number inside that category, and store
			your document there.
		</p>
	</div>

# Nothing is more than two levels deep

**You must not create a folder inside a Johnny.Decimal folder.**

If you do, you’ve created chaos. You might _think_ that this is innocent enough – you might even wonder how else you would do it.

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
	<div className="flex-shrink-0 mb-4 pr-4">
		<img
			src={Finder_sampleCompany_id3201IncorrectFolders}
			alt="Finder window showing folders incorrectly created in the folder 32.01 Launch campaign"
			width="293"
			height="172"
			className="screenshot"
		/>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			<em>
				“Surely you don’t have to create separate Johnny.Decimal numbers and
				folders for each of those things?”,
			</em>{" "}
			you’re thinking.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well <strong>of course you do.</strong>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

Those artefacts don’t live in isolation. They’re part of your business and they deserve their own home. You know what happens otherwise – a year later, someone wants a picture from that photo shoot, but nobody remembers where it is because it’s buried in this un-numbered folder.

## This costs you real money

You lose stuff. You spend ridiculous amounts of time finding stuff. You duplicate stuff. Or you look stupid because you use stuff that is out of date.

Stop it.
