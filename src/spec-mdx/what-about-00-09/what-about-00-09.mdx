# What about 00-09?

You may be wondering why we started our areas at <span className="jd-inline">10-19</span> and not <span className="jd-inline">00-09</span>, and our categories at <span className="jd-inline">11</span> rather than <span className="jd-inline">10</span>.

## We reserve these for the system

Sometimes you want to keep information _about the system_, in the
system. **I call this ‘Management &amp; Meta’.**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">Meta</a> basically means ‘self-referential’.
It’s about itself. Get it? If not, don’t stress.

# 00-09 is about the system itself

I always reserve these numbers for a special area called <span className="jd-inline">00-09 Management &amp; Meta</span>. Inevitably I want to store some information in my Johnny.Decimal system _about my Johnny.Decimal system_. That goes here.

For example, I have to save <Link to="/concepts/keeping-notes/">text notes</Link> in a folder on my disk. That folder has to live somewhere, and it lives in a category in <span className="jd-inline">00-09</span>.

One of the text notes I keep at work serves as a quick-reference index to my Johnny.Decimal system. It’s called <span className="jd-inline">00.00 Index</span>.

## 10, 20, 30 … 90 are about those categories

In the example we’ve been using, <span className="jd-inline">20-29</span> was <span className="jd-inline">Administration</span> but our first category was <span className="jd-inline">21 Company registration</span>. What happened to <span className="jd-inline">20</span>?

We reserve these numbers for ‘management &amp; meta’ information _about the category_. Although I hardly ever use them, it’s rare that I have more than nine categories in an area. I don’t miss the wasted number, but I always appreciate it when I need it.

# Confused? Don’t worry

If you want to use the zeros, use them. It doesn’t matter.
