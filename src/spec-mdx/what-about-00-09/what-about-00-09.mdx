# What about 00-09?

You may be wondering why we started our areas at <JD>10-19</JD> and not <JD>00-09</JD>, and our categories at <JD>11</JD> rather than <JD>10</JD>.

## We reserve these for the system

Sometimes you want to keep information _about the system_, in the
system. **I call this ‘Management &amp; Meta’.**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">Meta</a> basically means ‘self-referential’.
It’s about itself. Get it? If not, don’t stress.

# 00-09 is about the system itself

I always reserve these numbers for a special area called <JD>00-09 Management &amp; Meta</JD>. Inevitably I want to store some information in my Johnny.Decimal system _about my Johnny.Decimal system_. That goes here.

For example, I have to save <Link to="/concepts/keeping-notes/">text notes</Link> in a folder on my disk. That folder has to live somewhere, and it lives in a category in <JD>00-09</JD>.

One of the text notes I keep at work serves as a quick-reference index to my Johnny.Decimal system. It’s called <JD>00.00 Index</JD>.

## 10, 20, 30 … 90 are about those categories

In the example we’ve been using, <JD>20-29</JD> was <JD>Administration</JD> but our first category was <JD>21 Company registration</JD>. What happened to <JD>20</JD>?

We reserve these numbers for ‘management &amp; meta’ information _about the category_. Although I hardly ever use them, it’s rare that I have more than nine categories in an area. I don’t miss the wasted number, but I always appreciate it when I need it.

# Confused? Don’t worry

If you want to use the zeros, use them. It doesn’t matter.
