# Managing email

This won’t make you _enjoy_ email, but maybe you’ll hate it a little less.

## Make your Subject: work for you

There must be some sort of medical condition to describe the terrible dyslexia that overcomes people when they type email subjects. Here’s a real example from an old job:

<div className="emailSubject mr-2 sm:mr-6">
	<strong>Subject:</strong> EXTERNAL: RE: PO410192251
	-LUE-2016-04-28-MEL-Additional-Transformation-Cabling
</div>

Seriously. What the hell?

### Put the Johnny.Decimal number in the subject line

This might sound mad, but it works. Just put the relevant number in the subject line, and here’s the special sauce: put it in [square brackets]. So, my subject line becomes:

<div className="emailSubject mr-2 sm:mr-6">
	<strong>Subject:</strong> EXTERNAL: RE:
	PO410192251-LUE-2016-04-28-MEL-Additional-Transformation-Cabling{" "}
	<strong className="text-red-600">[72.02]</strong>
</div>

### Why? Search is why

You want to find that email related to the additional cabling. You either:

- know off the top of your head that <JD>72.02</JD> is the number you need, because you’ve used it a lot, or
- use <Link to="/concepts/tracking-your-numbers/">your index</Link> to look up the Johnny.Decimal number for ‘structured cabling’ if you don’t remember it.

If the email isn’t already in your <JD>72.02</JD> folder, just search for <JD>[72.02]</JD>.

The brackets around the numbers in the subject help your email’s search function pinpoint exactly what you want. The text ‘72.02’ might appear in a spreadsheet, or in someone’s phone number. The text ‘[72.02]’ almost certainly does not.

This has never failed me. **People ask me about an email and when I find it five seconds later, they say to me, “wow … how did you do that?”.**

## “But I write useful Subject: lines!”

That might be the case. _You_ do. But nobody else does.

With this system you can **add your own tag to someone else’s email.** And because it’s plain text in the subject line, it’ll follow the email around and return to you. In my experience, nobody notices it’s there.

# Putting things in folders

Since we typically move a _lot_ of emails in to folders, we want to minimise clicking.

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
	<div className="flex-shrink-0 mb-4 pr-4">
		<img
			src={outlook_folder_structure_1232_expanded}
			alt="Outlook window showing folder structure"
			width="293"
			height="155"
			className="screenshot"
		/>
	</div>
	<p>
		In my email client, I don’t create a folder for each area and then a folder
		for each category within it. I create folders for my categories at the top
		level. Do whatever works for you.
	</p>
</div>

Also, in case it isn’t obvious, you don’t need to create a folder for every Johnny.Decimal number _just because_. If you don’t get email related to that item, don’t create a folder.
