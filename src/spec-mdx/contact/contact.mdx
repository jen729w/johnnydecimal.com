# Contact me

However you like. My name is Johnny Noble. <span role="img" aria-label="Waving hand">👋🏻</span>

## Email me

The address is **&lt;hello&gt;** at **&lt;this domain&gt;**. Sorry it isn't linked, the spambots will get me otherwise.

## Call me

Yep. Any time. [+61 415 658 257](tel:+61415658257) (that’s an Australian number).

## Let’s visit!

I’m in Canberra, Australia. If your business is elsewhere, we can work something
out.

## Tweet me

[@johnnydecimal](https://twitter.com/johnnydecimal).

## Sign up to the mailing list

It’s _very_ low volume (emails sent since 2019: [1](https://buttondown.email/johnny.decimal/archive)), big update notifications only.
