# Ideas for posts

> 20th January 2021 | [#meta](/blog/tags/meta/)

This is just a memory-jogger page for me. I realise that this will be publicly posted, but that's fine. I'm enjoying this whole figure-it-out-in-public thing that seems to be happening these days.

This is what I plan to write about. [Let me know](/contact/) what else you'd like to see, or what you'd like prioritised from this list.

<div className="hidden">
	Hey there, RSS feed visitor! Nice to have you here. A note just for you: this
	page probably won't update in your feed as the URL never changes and that's
	what your feed reader looks at. I think that's okay, it's not the sort of
	thing you need to know about. But just in case you do care, now you know. :-)
</div>

In no order (just as they came to mind), but you can use the numbers to refer to these if you get in touch:

1. How you use your `- Note:` tags in your index.
2. A better description of the `00-09 Management & Meta` idea (Lucy has written notes).
3. Would people like a forum? A Slack? A Reddit? A Discord? Something else?
