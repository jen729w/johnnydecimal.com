# Blog

Posts are listed here with the newest at the top.

Ideas here are less well-formed than the pages under the main header, so forgive me if they aren't as clear or concise. The idea is that I can get stuff out of my head quickly without having to worry about it being perfect.

There's an <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> (which actually covers the whole site), and I'll post a link to each new article <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnydecimal">on Twitter</a>.
