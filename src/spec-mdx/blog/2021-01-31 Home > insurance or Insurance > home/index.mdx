I had the following question via email from Alan in London, Ontario, Canada (reprinted here with permission).

<div className=" border-blue-900 border-l-2 pl-4 text-blue-900">
	<p>
		One of the struggles that I have is whether - in your experience - things
		are better organized a) by the type of thing that it is, or b) by the
		subject of what it contains.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a practical example, I study Slavic languages and accumulate and need to
		access large quantities of reference materials. Let’s say I have several
		textbooks in PDF format on some aspect of the Russian verbal system. Am I
		better off with a category such as:
	</p>
	<p>20-29 Russian > 23 Textbooks and dictionaries > 23.02 Grammar textbooks</p>
	<p>or</p>
	<p>20-29 Russian > 25 Verbal system > 25.01 Verbal aspect</p>
	<p>
		I like the system because it is so determinate, but there is always some
		nagging orthogonal dimension to almost every thing that I store. It seems
		that tagging can address the orthogonality - but it begs the question - tag
		by subject, tag by entity type?
	</p>
	<p>
		This is my dilemma and I can see that the “epistemic hesitation” when trying
		to find a thing might take away some of the utility that I’d like to gain
		from the system.
	</p>

Alan's beautifully put email is a specific example of a very common question. That question most often comes in a more prosaic form, something like:

<div className=" border-blue-900 border-l-2 pl-4 text-blue-900 mb-4">
	“Do I put my house insurance in a category ‘insurance’ within my ‘house’ area,
	or in a ‘house’ category within my ‘insurance’ area?”
</div>

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 House</Area>
	<Category>11 Mortgage</Category>
	<Category>12 Maintenance</Category>
	<Category>
		13 Insurance<Comment indent={5}>// like this?</Comment>
	</Category>
</ACIDbox>

versus...

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Insurance</Area>
	<Category>11 Health</Category>
	<Category>12 Car</Category>
	<Category>
		13 House<Comment indent={9}>// or this?</Comment>
	</Category>
</ACIDbox>

And my answer to Alan:

<div className=" border-blue-900 border-l-2 pl-4 text-blue-900">
	<p>The answer, alas, is ‘it depends’.</p>
	<p>
		As of this moment I don't have a better answer than: just pick one, stick to
		the pattern, and trust your brain to figure it out. That’s why this is your
		system and I’m not trying to tell anyone how to do it. I’ll give people the
		underlying structure, but ultimately it’s your brain that has to come up
		with the content.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a back-stop you could always leave yourself a note in the ‘wrong’ folder,
		or set up an alias/link, but honestly I don’t think this is necessary. Pick
		one, use it three times, and your brain will look after the rest.
	</p>
</div>

Sorry that isn't more satisfying! But that's the realistic truth of this system: there's often no perfect solution. Don't let that get in the way of implementing _some_ solution, though. More organised is always better than less organised.
