# Finally...

> 15th January 2021

Well, that took longer that I'd planned. I had to learn how to do a bunch of stuff, but it feels good now that it's done.

The first post I'll put up will be an overview of a new project that I just set up, but I've been working on this all day and it's time for a beer. 😎🍺🇦🇺

I'll get the new post up over the weekend, then I really want to stick to a post a week. Let me know what you'd like me to write about! [@johnnydecimal](https://twitter.com/johnnydecimal)
