# Working at the terminal

The structured nature of the Johnny.Decimal numbering system lets you move to any folder with the minimum number of keystrokes using tab completion.

At each level, you know with certainty that **there will be no conflicting items.**

## Script your way around

Easier still, use a simple bash script to change to any directory immediately. Put this in your <span className="border border-gray-600 bg-gray-200 rounded-sm p-1 font-jdmono">.bashrc</span> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/jen729w/cab3a02bce70dab7a4567d460d5c36e2">plain text version here</a>).

	width="488"
	height="137"
	className="screenshot mb-4"
/>

And now change to any directory with <span className="border border-gray-600 bg-gray-200 rounded-sm p-1 font-jdmono">`cjd 34.27`</span>.

## Got any more?
