# IDs

Let’s get on to the decimal. We have a category—let’s say <span className="jd-inline">22 Contracts</span>—and we want to store some things there.

We create a Johnny.Decimal number by adding a decimal point to our category, and starting at number <span className="jd-inline">.01</span>.

We start at <span className="jd-inline">.01</span> and not just <span className="jd-inline">.1</span> because of the way that computers sort files. Also it’s more consistent, and consistency is elegant.

<span className="jd-inline text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 px-3 inline-block">
  22.01
</span>

Now we just decide what we’re keeping there and give it a nice name.

<span className="jd-inline text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 px-3 inline-block">
  22.01 Cleaning contract
</span>

Later, we need to store another contract. What to do? Just use the next
number.

<span className="jd-inline text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 px-3 inline-block">
  22.02 Office lease
</span>

## That was easy

You create a full Johnny.Decimal number by choosing a category and **looking for the next available number after the decimal.**

The thing to remember here is that the number after the decimal has _no meaning whatsoever:_ we just start at <span className="jd-inline">.01</span> and work our way up.

## “What happens when I get to 99?”

You never will. And if you do, the category you defined was almost certainly too broad. Split it up.

## Give your Johnny.Decimal items simple names

This system lets us give concise names to things, because we already know from the number which category they’re in.

I created <span className="jd-inline">22.01 Cleaning contract</span> because it’s short and
reads well, but you could have gone with <span className="jd-inline">22.01 Cleaning</span> if you’d preferred. You’re already in a folder called <span className="jd-inline">Contracts</span>.

**Everything that starts with** <span className="jd-inline">22</span> **is a contract**.
