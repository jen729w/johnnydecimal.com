# AC.ID notation

When I need to refer to the system in the abstract --- rather than talking about any _specific_ numbers --- I use the `AC.ID` notation.

---

<h2>
	Area Category ID = <span className="font-jdmono">AC.ID</span>
</h2>

Any Johnny.Decimal number is made up of the area/category before the decimal, then the ID after. So when I refer to `AC.ID`, I just mean _any number in your system_.

<h2>
	Project Area Category ID = <span className="font-jdmono">PRO.AC.ID</span>
</h2>

If you're using a [multiple-project system](/concepts/multiple-projects/), the notation is expanded and becomes `PRO.AC.ID`.
