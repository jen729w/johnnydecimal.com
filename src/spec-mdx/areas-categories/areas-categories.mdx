# Areas & categories

Let’s look again at the format of our numbers. It’s crucial that you understand _why_ they look like they do.

## The complete Johnny.Decimal number

Just as a reminder, every Johnny.Decimal number looks like this.

<div className="flex mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <OneReminder />
  <div className="hidden sm:block ml-4 max-w-xs text-sm italic">
    Here are a bunch of random numbers
    <br />
    from a theoretical system.
  </div>
</div>

In words, we have any two digits, followed by a decimal point, followed by two more digits.

## Group things together (categories)

Johnny.Decimal is all about **grouping similar things together**, so let’s start to do that.

<div className="flex mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <TwoGroupThingsTogether />
</div>

## Do it again (areas)

That’s starting to look more like something organised and a bit less like a bunch of random numbers. Let’s take it one step further.

<div className="flex mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <ThreeDoItAgain />
</div>

### Interesting...

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row mr-6 mb-6">
  <div className="">
    You can almost imagine this looking like a set of folders. If you didn’t
    care about anything except the 22 numbers, you could just collapse the
    others like this.
  </div>
  <div className="ml-4 flex-shrink-0">
    <img
      src={Finder_randomNumbers_category22Expanded}
      alt="macOS Finder window showing a three-level deep folder structure using the numbers from the examples above."
      width="182"
      height="153"
      className="screenshot"
    />
  </div>
</div>

# Of course, we’ve done this backwards

When we decide to organise something with Johnny.Decimal, we don’t _start_ with a bunch of numbers.

We start like this:

- First, we divide everything in our system in to (at most) ten large buckets of stuff. We call those our **areas**, and we assign each area a range like <span className="jd-inline">10-19</span>, <span className="jd-inline">20-29</span> … <span className="jd-inline">90-99</span>.
- Then, within each area, we break things up again in to (at most) ten more buckets. We call them **categories** and we assign them numbers like <span className="jd-inline">11</span>, <span className="jd-inline">12</span> … <span className="jd-inline">19</span>.
- Finally, we assign each individual thing in our system to a category, and give it a unique number. We start at <span className="jd-inline">.01</span> within each category, and work our way up through the numbers.

Let’s use a small company as an example, and write it out without the numbers.

<div className="mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <FourCompanyNoNumbers />
</div>

All we really do with Johnny.Decimal—and if at this point you’ve realised this and are thinking, “hang on, all he’s done is put numbers<sup>1</sup> in front of things,” well then you’re not far wrong—is put numbers in front of things.

**But this transforms the way you think about and use everything.** Trust me.

<div className="footnote-wrapper">
  <ol class="footnote">
    <li>
      I’ve seen countless filesystems with <strong>numbers</strong> in front of
      folder names, but if they’re not <strong>structured</strong> it doesn’t
      work.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

Let’s put numbers in front of the system we just built above.

<div className="mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <FiveCompanyWithNumbers />
</div>

## So long, cursed alphabet

What does this achieve? For one, it’s removed our dependence on the alphabet. The alphabet is a fine thing but it’s a terrible way to sort your files because things move around. Today we have:

<div className="mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <SixTodayWeHave />
</div>

and tomorrow the exports department come along and do this:

<div className="mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <SevenAndThenExports />
</div>

…and <span className="jd-inline">Finance</span> isn’t the second thing in the list any more. This sounds like a small thing, but <strong>it makes it impossible for your brain to learn where something will be.</strong>

## The Johnny.Decimal version

This is better:

<div className="mb-4 ml-4 mr-6">
  <EightThisIsBetter />
</div>

Because our folders all start with a number, they’ll sort in very predictable way. This concept applies throughout the system.

## 20, 60, 30, 90, whatever

At this point you might be wondering, well, why is <span className="jd-inline">Finance</span> all of the numbers from <span className="jd-inline">20-29</span> and why is <span className="jd-inline">Exports</span> <span className="jd-inline">40-49</span>? What do those numbers <em>mean</em>? And the answer is that they mean nothing. They’re just numbers. 40 isn’t better or worse than 20.

# In summary

On this page I’ve talked mostly about the way that we structure our areas and categories. By now you should have a good high-level understanding. You have categories of things and each category belongs to one area only. Areas group categories together.

All of this happens <em>before the decimal</em>. Those two digits of the number <strong>are the category</strong>, and the first digit of the number tells you which area it’s in.

What we’ve done here is organise a bunch of ‘stuff’ in to something with structure; we’ve created, essentially, a very simple database.
