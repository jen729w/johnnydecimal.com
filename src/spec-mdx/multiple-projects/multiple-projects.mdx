# Multiple-project systems

The system described so far works very well for a single project, or for one
individual's personal system. But when there are situations when we need more, we expand our system to allow for multiple projects.

## The problem

Let's say you're a freelancer. You might have set up a system like this.

<div className="block footnote-wrapper sm:hidden">
	<p className="footnote style-override">
		Some of these examples don't look so great on mobile, sorry. Rotating to
		landscape might help!
	</p>
</div>

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>11 ... // the usual stuff</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>20-29 Clients</Area>
	<Category>21 Best client</Category>
	<Category>22 Another client</Category>
	<ID>22.01 Job #1</ID>
	<ID>22.02 Job #2</ID>
	<Category>23 Third client</Category>
	<Category>...</Category>
	<Category>29 Ninth and final? client</Category>
</ACIDbox>

A couple of problems are obvious:

1. We are going to want to create folders within <JD>22.01 Job 1</JD> but the system says we shouldn't do that (and we shouldn't â€“ don't be tempted!).
2. This only allows us to have 10 clients.

We might try and fix it like this.

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>11 ... // the usual stuff</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>20-29 Best client</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>30-39 Another client</Area>
	<Category>31 Job #1</Category>
	<ID>31.01 Requirements</ID>
	<ID>31.02 Quote</ID>
	<ID>31.03 Artwork</ID>
	<ID>31.04 External images</ID>
	<ID>31.05 Final exported files</ID>
</ACIDbox>

...but that's still no good. Now we can only have ~9 clients, and each client can only have 10 jobs.

This problem is an unavoidable consequence of the way that the J.D system is designed: one of the **benefits** of the system is that "nothing is more than two levels deep". This is a problem when we need to structure information about clients and jobs which is itself two levels deep. We've run out of levels.

# Adding projects to the system

I've thought about this for a few years, and have been using the system I'll describe here since 2018. So far it's working well for me.

## Goals

The extended system must retain the advantages of the original Johnny.Decimal system.

1. Each item must have a unique identifier.
2. You must be able to search (your notes, your file system) for this identifier.
3. The identifier should be short and preferably memorable.

## Letters: no good

I tried systems using letters rather than numbers and they didn't work. My initial attempt looked something like this:

- <JD>HME.AC.ID</JD> = home system
- <JD>DVO.AC.ID</JD> = the DevOps project at work
- <JD>ETC.AC.ID</JD> = etc. for more projects

Now you just have to remember what those letters mean, and they don't add any semantic value to your system.

## The answer: more numbers

Here were my goals and constraints when introducing new numbers:

1. It must not confuse the system.
2. It must allow for a sufficient number of additional projects.
3. It must allow the user to organise those projects in some way (i.e. like you organise **categories** in to **areas**).

The solution is to **add a three-number project code to the start of your numbers**, e.g. <JD>000.AC.ID</JD>. In the abstract I'll refer to this as [PRO.AC.ID](/concepts/acid-notation/). ðŸ˜ƒ

### 1. It must not confuse the system

Three numbers is not two numbers.

I think if I'd gone with <JD>PR.AC.ID</JD>, e.g. <JD>10.12.53</JD>, that would have been a bit much on the brain. The only thing in the J.D system with three numbers is a project code.

### 2. It must allow for a sufficient number of additional projects

One thousand projects should be enough for anyone. I'd love to know what you're doing if you need more than a thousand projects.

### 3. It must allow the user to organise those projects in some way

We can use the same method of grouping as we currently use for our areas: simply group them by number according to our needs.

Here's what my current system looks like.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>100-199 Personal</Project>
	<Area>101 Personal system</Area>
	<Category>&nbsp;10-19 Administration</Category>
	<Category>&nbsp;... and so on</Category>
	<Area>102 Johnny.Decimal</Area>
	<Area>103 My next cool project ðŸ˜Ž</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>
		200-299 ACME Corp
		<Comment indent={9}>// my current contract</Comment>
	</Project>
	<Area>201 Work project #1</Area>
	<Area>202 Work project #2</Area>
	<Category>&nbsp;10-19 ... you get the idea</Category>
</PROACIDbox>

Alternatively, you can group your projects by tens, rather than hundreds. This might work better if you're a freelancer vs. a long-term contractor.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project classes="no-underline">100-109 First client's projects</Project>
	<Area>101 Project #1 for first client</Area>
	<Category>&nbsp;10-19 Administration</Category>
	<Category>&nbsp;...</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project classes="no-underline">110-119 Second client's projects</Project>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project classes="no-underline">120-129 Third client, and so on...</Project>
	<Comment indent={8}>// note that no client can have more than</Comment>
	<Comment indent={11}>10 projects if you group like this</Comment>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project classes="no-underline">130-139 Fourth client's projects</Project>
	<Area>131 Then you number your projects like this</Area>
	<ID>&nbsp;131.32.73 And individual items like this</ID>
</PROACIDbox>

Of course, you don't have to group your projects at all if you don't want or need to. In this case your projects will sort by order of creation, just like individual IDs do within a category.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project classes="no-underline">101 Project 1 for client A</Project>
	<Project classes="no-underline">
		102 Project 2 for your own personal thing
	</Project>
	<Project classes="no-underline">103 Project 3 for client B</Project>
	<Project classes="no-underline">104 Project 4 also for client B</Project>
	<Project classes="no-underline">105 Project 5 for client A again</Project>
	<Project classes="no-underline">106 Project 6 for client C</Project>
	<Project classes="no-underline">107 ... and you get the idea</Project>
</PROACIDbox>

# Implementation details

For most people who are in this situation, I think you should use one project for all of the stuff that is general to your life/business/etc.

So what I mean is we go from something like this.

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Area>20-29 Marketing</Area>
	<Category>21 Advertising</Category>
	<Area>30-39 Finance</Area>
	<Category>31 Accounting</Category>
	<Category>32 Contracts</Category>
	<Area>40-49 Clients</Area>
	<Category>41 ... // this is what didn't work</Category>
	<Category>42 ...</Category>
</ACIDbox>

...to this.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>101 Administration</Project>
	<Area>
		10-19 Administration
		<Comment indent={3}>// this is all the stuff</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Area>
		20-29 Marketing
		<Comment indent={8}>// from above, just in</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Category>
		21 Advertising
		<Comment indent={6}>// its own 'project'</Comment>
	</Category>
	<Area>30-39 Finance</Area>
	<Category>31 Accounting</Category>
	<Category>32 Contracts</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>
		102 First project
		<Comment indent={10}>// and now we break out all</Comment>
	</Project>
	<Area>
		10-19 ...
		<Comment indent={14}>// of the actual projects</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Area>
		20-29 ...
		<Comment indent={14}>// as discussed above</Comment>
	</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>103 Second project</Project>
	<Area>10-19 ...</Area>
</PROACIDbox>

# How I name my folders and files

I don't use the project number in my area or category folders. This is because they tend to be fairly unique anyway, with the exception of my ubiquitous <JD>10-19 Administration</JD>.

I **do** use the project number in my ID folders, and when I name files. There are a couple of reasons why I've found this to be right for me.

1. When I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)<sup>1</sup>, which I do many times a day, I can type the full <JD>PRO.AC.ID</JD> number and it'll open the folder immediately.
2. When you view the _Open Recent_ menu â€” e.g. in Microsoft Excel â€” the filename shows the project name at the beginning. I find this really useful.

<div class="footnote-wrapper">
	<ol class="footnote">
		<li>
			If you use macOS, you should use Alfred. Activate it, press the spacebar
			to enter 'Open File...' mode, then type the name of a folder.{" "}
			<span className="not-italic">ðŸ¤¯</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

So this means that my system looks like this.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>496 Any old project</Project>
	<Area>10-19 ...</Area>
	<Area>
		20-29 An interesting area{" "}
		<span className="text-gray-400 font-light">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// no project number here
		</span>
	</Area>
	<Category>
		21 A great category{" "}
		<span className="text-gray-400 font-light">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or here
		</span>
	</Category>
	<ID>
		496.21.11 My favourite ID{" "}
		<span className="font-bold">// but check me out!</span>
	</ID>
</PROACIDbox>

<!-- Break the long string on mobile -->

<div className="hidden sm:block">
	Within that folder, if I saved an Excel file I would call that file{" "}
	<JD>496.21.11 Whatever descriptive name I'd use.xlsx</JD>.
</div>
<div className="block sm:hidden text-base">
	Within that folder, if I saved an Excel file I would call that file{" "}
	<JD>
		496.21.11 Whatever descriptive
		<br />
		name I'd use.xlsx
	</JD>
	.
</div>

As with most aspects of this system, you should adapt it to your needs. Try a few things and see what works. Change often â€“ don't think that the first way you implement a thing will be the right one, I've found it needs experimentation to get just right.
