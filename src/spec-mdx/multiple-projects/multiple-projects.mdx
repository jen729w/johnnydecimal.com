<!-- Note to self: this is the only page (so far) where you're showing *groupings* of projects. I don't anticipate ever doing this again, so I haven't created a custom <PROACIDbox> for it. Hence all the &nbsp; and other junk here. -->

# Multiple-project systems

The system described so far works very well for a single project, or for one
individual's personal system. But when there are situations when we need more, we expand our system to allow for multiple projects.

## The problem

Let's say you're a freelancer. You might have set up a system like this.

<div className="sm:hidden">
	<Footnote>
		Some of these examples don't look so great on mobile, sorry. Rotating to
		landscape might help!
	</Footnote>
</div>

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>
		11 ... <Comment>// the usual stuff</Comment>
	</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>20-29 Clients</Area>
	<Category>21 Best client</Category>
	<Category>22 Another client</Category>
	<ID>22.01 Job #1</ID>
	<ID>22.02 Job #2</ID>
	<Category>23 Third client</Category>
	<Category>...</Category>
	<Category>29 Ninth and final? client</Category>
</ACIDbox>

A couple of problems are obvious:

1. We are going to want to create folders within `22.01 Job 1` but the system says we shouldn't do that (and we shouldn't â€“ don't be tempted!).
2. This only allows us to have 10 clients.

We might try and fix it like this.

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>11 ...</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>20-29 Best client</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>30-39 Another client</Area>
	<Category>31 Job #1</Category>
	<ID>31.01 Requirements</ID>
	<ID>31.02 Quote</ID>
	<ID>31.03 Artwork</ID>
	<ID>31.04 External images</ID>
	<ID>31.05 Final exported files</ID>
</ACIDbox>

...but that's still no good. Now we can only have ~9 clients, and each client can only have 10 jobs.

This problem is an unavoidable consequence of the way that the J.D system is designed: one of the **benefits** of the system is that "nothing is more than two levels deep". This is a problem when we need to structure information about clients and jobs which is itself two levels deep. We've run out of levels.

# Adding projects to the system

I've thought about this for a few years, and have been using the system I'll describe here since 2018. So far it's working well for me.

## Goals

The extended system must retain the advantages of the original Johnny.Decimal system.

1. Each item must have a unique identifier.
2. You must be able to search (your notes, your file system) for this identifier.
3. The identifier should be short and preferably memorable.

## Letters: no good

I tried systems using letters rather than numbers and they didn't work. My initial attempt looked something like this:

- `HME.AC.ID` = home system
- `DVO.AC.ID` = the DevOps project at work
- `ETC.AC.ID` = etc. for more projects

Now you just have to remember what those letters mean, and they don't add any semantic value to your system.

## The answer: more numbers

Here were my goals and constraints when introducing new numbers:

1. It must not confuse the system.
2. It must allow for a sufficient number of additional projects.
3. It must allow the user to organise those projects in some way (i.e. like you organise **categories** in to **areas**).

The solution is to **add a three-number project code to the start of your numbers**, e.g. `000.AC.ID`. In the abstract I'll refer to this as [PRO.AC.ID](/concepts/acid-notation/). ðŸ˜ƒ

### 1. It must not confuse the system

Three numbers is not two numbers.

I think if I'd gone with `PR.AC.ID`, e.g. `10.12.53`, that would have been a bit much on the brain. The only thing in the J.D system with three numbers is a project code.

### 2. It must allow for a sufficient number of additional projects

One thousand projects should be enough for anyone. I'd love to know what you're doing if you need more than a thousand projects.

### 3. It must allow the user to organise those projects in some way

We can use the same method of grouping as we currently use for our areas: simply group them by number according to our needs.

Here's what my current system looks like.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>100-199 Personal</Project>
	<Area>101 Personal system</Area>
	<Category>&nbsp;10-19 Administration</Category>
	<Comment indent={8}>// ... and so on</Comment>
	<Area>102 Johnny.Decimal</Area>
	<Area>103 My next cool project ðŸ˜Ž</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>
		200-299 ACME Corp
		<Comment indent={9}>// my current contract</Comment>
	</Project>
	<Area>201 Work project #1</Area>
	<Area>202 Work project #2</Area>
	<Category>&nbsp;10-19 ...</Category>
</PROACIDbox>

Alternatively, you can group your projects by tens, rather than hundreds. This might work better if you're a freelancer vs. a long-term contractor.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>100-109 First client's projects</Project>
	<Area>101 Project #1 for first client</Area>
	<Category>&nbsp;10-19 Administration</Category>
	<Category>&nbsp;...</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>110-119 Second client's projects</Project>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>120-129 Third client, and so on...</Project>
	<Comment indent={8}>// note that no client can have more than</Comment>
	<Comment indent={8}>// 10 projects if you group like this</Comment>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>130-139 Fourth client's projects</Project>
	<Area>131 Then you number your projects like this</Area>
	<ID>&nbsp;131.32.73 And individual items like this</ID>
</PROACIDbox>

Of course, you don't have to group your projects at all if you don't want or need to. In this case your projects will just sort by order of creation.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>101 Project 1 for client A</Project>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>...</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>102 Project 2 for your own personal thing</Project>
	<Area>...</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>
		103 Project 3 for client B<Comment indent={7}>// ... and so on</Comment>
	</Project>
	<Project>104 Project 4 also for client B</Project>
	<Project>105 Project 5 for client A again</Project>
	<Project>106 Project 6 for client C</Project>
	<Project>
		107<Comment indent={1}>// ... and you get the idea</Comment>
	</Project>
</PROACIDbox>

# Implementation details

For most people who are in this situation, I think you should use one project for all of the stuff that is general to your life/business/etc.

So what I mean is we go from something like this...

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Area>20-29 Marketing</Area>
	<Category>21 Advertising</Category>
	<Area>30-39 Finance</Area>
	<Category>31 Accounting</Category>
	<Category>32 Contracts</Category>
	<Area>40-49 Clients</Area>
	<Category>
		41 ...<Comment indent={4}>// this is what didn't work</Comment>
	</Category>
	<Category>42 ...</Category>
</ACIDbox>

...to this.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>101 Administration</Project>
	<Area>
		10-19 Administration
		<Comment indent={3}>// this is all the stuff</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Area>
		20-29 Marketing
		<Comment indent={8}>// from above, just in</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Category>
		21 Advertising
		<Comment indent={6}>// its own 'project'</Comment>
	</Category>
	<Area>30-39 Finance</Area>
	<Category>31 Accounting</Category>
	<Category>32 Contracts</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>
		102 First project
		<Comment indent={10}>// and now we break out all</Comment>
	</Project>
	<Area>
		10-19 ...
		<Comment indent={14}>// of the actual projects</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Area>
		20-29 ...
		<Comment indent={14}>// as discussed above</Comment>
	</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Project>103 Second project</Project>
	<Area>10-19 ...</Area>
</PROACIDbox>

# How I name my folders and files

I don't use the project number in my area or category folders. This is because they tend to be fairly unique anyway, with the exception of my ubiquitous `10-19 Administration`.

I **do** use the project number in my ID folders, and when I name files. There are a couple of reasons why I've found this to be right for me.

1. When I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)<sup>1</sup>, which I do many times a day, I can type the full `PRO.AC.ID` number and it'll open the folder immediately.
2. When you view the _Open Recent_ menu â€” e.g. in Microsoft Excel â€” the filename shows the project name at the beginning. I find this really useful.

<Footnote indent>
	1. If you use macOS, you should use Alfred. Activate it, press the spacebar to
	enter 'Open File...' mode, then type the number of a folder.{" "}
	<span className="not-italic">ðŸ¤¯</span>
</Footnote>

So this means that my system looks like this.

<PROACIDbox>
	<Project>496 Any old project</Project>
	<Area>10-19 ...</Area>
	<Area>
		20-29 An interesting area
		<Comment indent={4}>// no project number here</Comment>
	</Area>
	<Category>
		21 A great category
		<Comment indent={7}>// or here</Comment>
	</Category>
	<ID>496.21.11 My favourite ID</ID>
	<Comment indent={14}>// but check me out!</Comment>
</PROACIDbox>

Within that folder, if I saved an Excel file I would call that file <code style="white-space: break-spaces;">496.21.11 Whatever descriptive name I'd use.xlsx</code>.

As with most aspects of this system, you should adapt it to your needs. Try a few things and see what works. Change often â€“ don't think that the first way you implement a thing will be the right one, I've found it needs experimentation to get just right.
