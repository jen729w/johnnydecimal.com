# Multiple projects

When I started this system I was running a specific project, and I didn't
really consider the need for multiple projects on the same computer.

If two projects never meet, there's no issue. I have a project at work with one
set of numbers and my system at home with another, totally unrelated, set of
numbers. No problem at all â€“ it's like I'm two people leading separate lives.

Fast-forward a decade and I find myself needing more. I still have my personal
system, but I work as a contractor and the projects I run for other people must
exist alongside my personal stuff, and each other.
