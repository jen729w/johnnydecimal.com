# Multiple-project systems

The system described so far works very well for a single project, or for one
individual's personal system. There are situations when we need more: we expand our system to use multiple projects.

## The problem

Let's imagine that you're a freelancer. You might have set up a system like this.

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>11 ... // the usual stuff</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>20-29 Clients</Area>
	<Category>21 Best client</Category>
	<Category>22 Another client</Category>
	<ID>22.01 Job #1</ID>
	<ID>22.02 Job #2</ID>
	<Category>23 Third client</Category>
	<Category>...</Category>
	<Category>29 Ninth and final? client</Category>
</ACIDbox>

A couple of problems are obvious:

1. We are going to want to create folders within <JD>22.01 Job 1</JD> but the system says we shouldn't do that (and we shouldn't â€“ don't be tempted!).
2. This only allows us to have 10 clients.

We might try and fix it like this.

<ACIDbox>
	<Area>10-19 Administration</Area>
	<Category>11 ... // the usual stuff</Category>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>20-29 Best client</Area>
	<BlankRow />
	<Area>30-39 Another client</Area>
	<Category>31 Job #1</Category>
	<ID>31.01 Requirements</ID>
	<ID>31.02 Quote</ID>
	<ID>31.03 Artwork</ID>
	<ID>31.04 External images</ID>
	<ID>31.05 Final exported files</ID>
</ACIDbox>

...but that's still no good. Now we can only have ~9 clients, and each client can only have 10 jobs.

This problem is an unavoidable consequence of the way that the JD system is designed: one of the **benefits** of the system is that "nothing is more than two levels deep". This is a problem when we need to structure information about clients and jobs which is itself two levels deep. We've run out of levels.
