# Multiple-project systems

When I started this system I was running a specific project, and I didn't
really consider the need for multiple projects on the same computer.

If two projects never meet, there's no issue. I have a project at work with one
set of numbers and my system at home with another, totally unrelated, set of
numbers. No problem at all – it's like I'm two people leading separate lives.

Fast-forward a decade and I find myself needing more. I still have my personal
system, but I work as a contractor and the projects I run for other people must
exist alongside my personal stuff, and each other.

The system described so far works very well for a single project, or for one
individual's personal system. In some scenarios, however, it falls short. The
solution in this case is to expand to the system as described here.
