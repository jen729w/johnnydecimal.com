<!-- # A system to organise projects -->

<h1 class="sm:hidden">A system to<br/>organise projects</h1>

When we kept everything on paper, organised people had these things called filing cabinets. They stored all of their documents in them in a structured way so that they could find them again.

Now those same people store all of their files in arbitrarily named folders on their company’s shared drive and wonder why they can’t find anything.

## Nobody can find anything any more

Thousands of emails. Hundreds of files. File structures created on a whim and six layers deep. Duplication of content, lost content. **We thought search would save us from this nightmare, but we were wrong.**

# It’s time to get organised

There are a couple of core concepts, and they’re so simple you’ll wonder why you haven’t thought of them before.

It’s worth mentioning at this point that **all of this is free,** and it’s possible to implement it without any additional tools.

## Step 1: Divide everything in to ten things

1. Take everything you need to organise and sort it in to, at most, ten large buckets.
2. Make sure the buckets are unambiguously different.
3. Put a label on each bucket.

This forces you to group things quite broadly, but that’s the point.

**We call these buckets your areas.** An area might be <span class="jd-inline">Finance</span>.

## Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again

Go through each bucket and repeat the process. **This creates your categories**.

A category within the <span class="jd-inline">Finance</span> area might be <span class="jd-inline">Tax Returns</span>.

Now we have ten areas which contain ten categories each. That’s a hundred categories **at the very most**. It’s very unlikely you will end up with a hundred categories.

## Categories are the key

What’s a category? It’s just a collection of stuff. Book drafts. Travel itineraries. Lease agreements. Test reports. Contracts. **Any type of work you do can become a category.**

The point is that you’ve _defined_ these categories, each of which
is contained within a broader area. You do this when you set up your
system, which we’ll get to shortly.

### We give each category a number

Remember they’re grouped in tens, so our first ten categories will be numbers <span class="jd-inline">10-19</span> and they will all be related to each other.

Let’s say <span class="jd-inline">10-19</span> is our <span class="jd-inline">Finance</span> area. Category <span class="jd-inline">11</span> might be <span class="jd-inline">Tax returns</span>, <span class="jd-inline">12 Payroll</span>, and so on.

We also know that <span class="jd-inline">42</span> will not be a finance-related category. This is the power of the system: you know where you absolutely should _not_ bother looking to find your data.

# Now we bring in the numbers

A Johnny.Decimal number looks like this:

<span class="mr-5 text-2xl sm:text-4xl jd-inline">42.18</span>
<span class="mr-5 text-2xl sm:text-4xl jd-inline">12.03</span>
<span class="text-2xl sm:text-4xl jd-inline">63.17</span>

They’re short, memorable, and can be spoken out loud. **They’re always two digits, a decimal point, and two more digits.**

Say it like “forty-two eighteen” or “twelve dot oh-three”.

## Before the decimal: category

The decimal point is there to break the number up, but more importantly to remind you that **the number before the decimal is the important part.** It’s the category.

The category tells you which area it’s in, because all areas start with the same number. If your category starts with the digit <span class="jd-inline">1</span>, that’s something to do with <span class="jd-inline">Finance</span>.

At a glance, you know what the number contains. You’ll be astonished at how many of your category numbers you remember.

## After the decimal: ID

The number after the decimal is just a counter. **We call it the ID:** it starts at <span class="jd-inline">.01</span> and increases with each thing you create.

In these examples, <span class="jd-inline">42.18</span> is the 18th thing you’ve saved in your
<span class="jd-inline">42</span> category.

The 3rd thing you’ve saved in your <span class="jd-inline">12 Payroll</span> category might be <span class="jd-inline">12.03 Payroll schedule 2018</span>.

**The ID doesn’t have any relevance to the item itself** – remember, it’s just a counter.

# I get the idea, but why bother?

Many, many reasons.

## Organise your files. Properly

The most obvious use of Johnny.Decimal is in organising your folder structure.
