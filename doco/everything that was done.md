# Everything that was done

> Everything!

# Code

## Create the blank Gatsby site

- `gatsby new learn.johnnydecimal.com`

## Add Tailwind CSS

> Note: we're just going to use `npm` because that's what the Gatsby docs use.

From [the documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/):

- `npm install tailwindcss --save-dev`

Generate the Tailwind configuration file, we'll need it later.

- `npx tailwindcss init`
